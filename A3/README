To run the program type make in the command line.
Make creates two file, a testing and main file.
To run the main file you must execute as follows:
	./prog1 <TEXTFILE.TXT>
To run the tesMail file you mest execute as follow:
	./prog2
To remove the binary files:
        make clean
**************************************************

*************************************************
Assumptions: the TEXTFILE.TXT contains words. 
If a line in the text file does not start with a 
letter then it will not be added to the hashMap.
*************************************************

*********************************************************
Limitations: The program is limited to holding 1000
line of a text file. It will not hold more than 1000 lines.
Each line cannot be more than 1000 characters in length.
The size of the hashTable is 26.
Search will only word for words spelt exactly as they are
in the dictionary.
**********************************************************

*********************************************************
Collision Resolution Strategy: The algorithm uses seperate
chaining when hashing a key returns a value that is already
in the hashMap. The new value will be added to the end of a
linkedList contained in the hashTable.
